Prestasi	-> Decrease in KP Prestasi from May to June 
			(could be from lack of manual inputs from students or general decrease in participants)

PPK Ormawa	-> Proposal awal semester
		-> Cari lokasi, then prodi and UKM
		-> Hanya boleh 1 ormawa
		-> Hard to find cuz villages in Jatim have improved also mahasiswa mau deket
		-> Daerah Tegalsari (High in HIV and AIDS cases, popular for STD checkups)
		-> Ormawa activities have to be related to the UKMs
		-> Prof. Jenny wants people in UKM to join PPK but normally students join UKM just for KP (conflicting views)
		-> All PPK activities can be continuous (in the same village) as long as there's innovation or something new
		-> Untuk Ormawa, harus mbikin jadwal clear
		-> Main issue: How can we make more people join PPK Ormawa?
		-> Potential solutions:
			a. Take the gamble
				- If even 1 person joins, it's acceptable cuz organisations (SRB, MD) wajib ikut

Sesi Info Ormawa	-> Sesi info general (What is PPK Ormawa)
			-> List of available villages
			-> Examples of past PPK Ormawa activities
			-> Main issue: How can we make more people understand PPK Ormawa and perhaps easier?
			-> Potential solutions:
				a. Split into several sessions
					- First meeting is info session and theme
					- Second is looking for members and villages
					- Have a regular pembinaan session for those who join (Make a timeline for activities)
			-> Next step:
				1. 18 September ada sesi sosialisasi
				2. Schedule a meeting for Selasa, 10 September Jam 15.00
				3. 9 Okt ada klinik
				4. 10 Okt harus milih tema
